If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?\\nA: Let's think step by step. [/INST] 1. Tina makes $18.00 an hour.\\n2. If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime.\\n3. Overtime pay is calculated as her hourly wage + 1/2 her hourly wage.\\n4. So, if Tina works more than 8 hours in a shift, she gets paid $18.00 + (1/2) * $18.00 = $27.00 per hour for overtime.\\n5. Tina works 10 hours every day for 5 days.\\n6. Therefore, she works a total of 10 hours/day * 5 days = 50 hours.\\n7. Since she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime.\\n\"]\n",
