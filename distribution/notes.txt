["<s> [INST] Q: Mark has a garden with flowers. He planted plants of three different colors in it. Ten of them are yellow, and there are 80% more of those in purple. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?\nA: Let's think step by step. [/INST] Let's denote the number of purple flowers as X. Since there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers, and there are 10 yellow flowers, we can write the equation: X = 10 * 1.8 = 18.\n\nLet's denote the number of green flowers as Y. Since there are 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers, we can write: Y = 10 + 10 + 18 * 0.25 = 15.\n\nTherefore, Mark has a total of 10 (yellow) + 18 (purple) + 15 (green) = <<10+18+15=43>>43 flowers in his garden.</s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s>",

There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?\nA: Let's think step by step. [/INST] Let's denote the number of purple flowers as x. Since there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow ones, the number of yellow flowers is x/1.25. The number of green flowers is 25% of the number of yellow and purple flowers combined, so it's 0.25 * (x + x/1.25).\n\nWe have three equations based on the given information:\n\n1. x + (x/1.25) + 0.25 * (x + x/1.25) = total number of flowers\n2. x + x/1.25 = 10 (yellow flowers) * 1.25\n3. 0.25 * (x + x/1.25) = 25% of (x + x/1.25)\n\nLet's solve equation 2 for x:\n\nx + x/1.25 = 12.5\nx(1 + 1/1.25) = 12.5\nx = 12.5 * 1.25 / 2\nx = 15\n\nNow let's calculate the number of yellow and purple flowers:\n\nYellow flowers = x/1.25 = 15/1.25 ≈ 12\nPurple flowers = 1.25 * Yellow flowers = 1.25 * 12 ≈ 15\n\nLet's check if the total number of flowers is correct:\n\nTotal number of flowers = 12 (yellow) + 15 (purple) + 0.25 * (12 + 15) ≈ 12 + 15 + 6.25 = 23.25\n\nHowever, the total number of flowers should be a whole number. It seems like there is a mistake in the problem statement or our calculations. We cannot determine the exact number of flowers in the garden with the given information.</s>",

<s> [INST] Q: Julie is reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?
A: Let's think step by step. [/INST] 1. Julie reads 120 pages in total.
2. Yesterday, she read 12 pages, leaving 108 pages to be read.
3. Today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday, so she read 24 pages.
4. This leaves 84 pages to be read tomorrow (108 - 24).
5. Julie wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, which is 84 / 2 = 42 pages.

A: Let's think step by step. [/INST] Julie started reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she read 12 pages, which means she has 120 - 12 = <<120-12=108>>108 pages left to read.

Today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday, which is 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 pages. This leaves her with 108 - 24 = <<108-24=84>>84 pages left to read.

Tomorrow, she wants to read half of the remaining pages.

A: Let's think step by step. [/INST] Julie has read 12 pages yesterday and today she read twice as many pages as yesterday, which means she read 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 pages today.

The total number of pages in the book is 120. After reading 24 pages today, Julie has read a total of 36 pages (12 + 24).

Tomorrow, she wants to read half of the remaining pages. The remaining pages are 120 - 36 = <<120-36=84>>84 pages.
