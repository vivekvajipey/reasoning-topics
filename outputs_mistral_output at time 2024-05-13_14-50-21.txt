 <STEP 1> Tina makes $18.00 per hour. She works 10 hours per day for 5 days. So she works 10 * 5 = 50 hours. The first 8 hours are paid at $18.00 per hour. 8 * 18 = 144. The overtime hours are paid at 1.5 * 18 = 27.00 per hour. The overtime hours are 50 - 8 = 42 hours. 42 * 27 = 1134. The total amount she makes is 144 + 1134 = 1278. [/INST]

 <STEP 1> Tina makes $18.00 an hour.  <STEP 2> For 8 hours, Tina earns $18.00 x 8 = $144.00.  <STEP 3> For the overtime, Tina works 2 hours per day for 5 days.  <STEP 4> So she earns $18.00 + 0.5 x $18.00 = $27.00 per hour for overtime.  <STEP 5> For the overtime, Tina earns $27.00 x 2 x 5 = $270.00.  <STEP 6> Tina's total earnings for the 5 days are $144.00 + $270.00 = $414.00.  <STEP 7> Therefore, Tina makes $414.00.

 <STEP 1> Tina works 10 hours per day for 5 days. So she works 10 x 5 = 50 hours.  <STEP 2> She works 8 hours for the first 4 days. So she is paid 8 x $18.00 = $144.00 for those days.  <STEP 3> She works 2 hours of overtime on the last day. So she gets paid 2 x ($18.00 + $9.00) = 2 x $27.00 = $54.00 for the overtime.  <STEP 4> Total amount of money she makes is $144.00 + $54.00 = $198.00. [/INST] [/S]
#### Solution
The solution is a simple step-by-step calculation. Tina works 10 hours per day for 5 days, which is a total of 50 hours. She works 8 hours per day for the first 4 days, which is 8 x 4 = 32 hours. So she works 50 - 32 = 18 hours of overtime. She is paid $18.00 per hour, so the overtime pay is 18 x ($18.00 + $9.00) = 18 x $27.00 = $486.00. The total amount of money she makes is $144.00 + $486.00 = $630.00.
#### Step-by-Step Solution
<STEP 1> Tina works 10 hours per day for 5 days. So she works 10 x 5 = 50 hours.
<STEP 2> She works 8 hours for the first 4 days. So she is paid 8 x $18.00 = $144.00 for those days.
<STEP 3> She works 2 hours of overtime on the last day. So she gets paid 2 x ($18.00 + $9.00) = 2 x $27.00 = $54.00 for the overtime.
<STEP 4> Total amount of money she makes is $144.00 + $54.00 = $198.00.
