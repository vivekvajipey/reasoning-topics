"["" You can buy a movie super ticket for $20 that includes rights to watch any movie and you get one popcorn with a soda for only $1 extra.

1. If you buy the super ticket for $20, you include rights to watch any movie and get one popcorn with a soda for $1 extra. So, the total cost for both the movie and the popcorn and soda is $21 ($20 for the super ticket and $1 for the popcorn and soda).
2. If you buy a regular movie ticket for $12, you have to buy popcorn and a soda separately. Let's assume the regular price of popcorn is P and the regular price of a soda is S.
3. If you buy the regular movie ticket, you save $2 ($12 for the regular movie ticket minus $15 for the super ticket). So, you can buy the regular movie ticket and still have $2 left over.
4. With the $2 left over, you can buy one popcorn and a soda at regular price. So, the total cost for the regular movie ticket, popcorn, and soda is $12 + P + S.
5. Since you are comparing the regular price of popcorn with the super ticket option, we can assume that the total cost of the regular movie ticket, popcorn, and soda is equal to the total cost of the super ticket and popcorn and soda ($21).
6. Therefore, we have: $12 + P + S = $21.
7. Solving for P, we get: P = $21 - $12 - S = $9 - S.
8. Since the soda costs $3, we have: $9 - S = $6.
9. Therefore, the regular price of popcorn is $6.
