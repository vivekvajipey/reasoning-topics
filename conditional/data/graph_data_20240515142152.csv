"["" For a New Year's resolution, Andy wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is July 19th. Today is December 31st. If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?""]",0,"First, we need to figure out how many days are between December 31st and July 19th. 

To do this, we can subtract December 31st from July 19th: 

79 - 31 = 48 days 

So Andy has 48 days to lose 30 lbs. 

Next, we need to find out how many calories Andy needs to burn in total to lose those 30 lbs. 

We know that he needs to burn 3500 calories per pound, so: 

30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories 

Now, we need to find out how many calories Andy needs to consume each day to reach his goal. 

We'll divide the total number of calories he needs to burn (105,000) by the number of days he has (48): 

105,000 calories / 48 days = 2187.5 calories/day 

However, this number is not realistic since Andy can't eat a fraction of a calorie. 

So we'll round up to the nearest whole number, which is 2188 calories/day. 

Finally, we'll subtract the number of calories Andy needs to consume each day (2188) from the number of calories he burns each day (which we'll assume is 2000 for now) to find his calorie deficit: 

2000 - 2188 = -188 

Andy needs a calorie deficit of -188 each day to reach his goal of losing 30 lbs. by his birthday.","['First, we need to figure out how many days are between December 31st and July 19th. \n\nTo do this, we can subtract December 31st from July 19th: \n\n79 - 31 = 48 days \n\nSo Andy has 48 days to lose 30 lbs.

We can use the following formula to calculate the number of days:

(End Date - Start Date) / Days per Year + 1

(July 19th - December 31st) / 365 + 1 = 136 days

So, Andy has 136 days to reach his goal.

Next, we need to determine how many calories Andy needs to consume in those 136 days to gain or maintain his current weight. Let's assume that his current weight is 200 lbs.

To maintain his weight, Andy would need to consume approximately 2000 calories per day (based on his weight and activity level).

However, since Andy wants to lose 30 lbs., we'll calculate the daily caloric intake required to lose weight:

Caloric Intake for Weight Loss = Daily Caloric Intake for Maintenance - Calories Burned per Pound

Caloric Intake for Weight Loss = 2000 calories - (3500 calories/pound × 30 pounds)

Caloric Intake for Weight Loss = 2000 calories - 105,000 calories

Caloric Intake for Weight Loss = 104,000 calories

Now, let's calculate the daily calorie deficit needed to lose 30 lbs.:

Daily Calorie Deficit = (Caloric Intake for Weight Loss - Daily Caloric Intake for Maintenance) / Days

Daily Calorie Deficit = (104,000 calories - 2000 calories) / 136 days

Daily Calorie Deficit ≈ 782 calories

To do this, we can use the following formula: 

number of days = (date - start date) / (365 days per year) 

In this case: 

date = December 31st (31 December) 

start date = July 19th (19 July) 

So, 

number of days = (31 December - 19 July) / 365 days per year = 126 days 

Now that we know there are 126 days between today and Andy's birthday, we can calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to reach his goal: 

total calories burned = (calories burned per day) x (number of days) 

We also know that: 

calories burned per day = 3500 calories (to lose 1 pound) 

So, 

total calories burned = 3500 calories/day x 126 days = 4,380,000 calories 

To find the calorie deficit, we need to subtract the total number of calories Andy has consumed from the total number of calories he needs to burn: 

calorie deficit = total calories burned - total calories consumed 

Unfortunately, we don't have information about the total number of calories Andy has consumed. However, we can figure out the daily calorie deficit: 

daily calorie deficit = (calories burned per day) x (number of days)

So, Andy needs to burn a net amount of 4,380,000 calories to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday. 

To calculate the daily calorie deficit, we can divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:

Total days = (July 19th - December 31st) + 1 = 192 days

Next, let's calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to reach his goal of losing 30 lbs:

Calories burned = Total pounds to lose * Calories burned per pound
Calories burned = 30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories

Now, let's calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to consume during these 192 days:

Calories consumed = Total days * Calories consumed per day
Calories consumed = 192 days * (Calories burned per day + Calories deficit)

We know that Andy needs to burn an extra 3500 calories each day to lose a pound. So, we can calculate the daily calorie deficit as follows:

Daily calorie deficit = Calories burned per day - Calories consumed per day

Let x be the number of calories burned per day. Then:

x = Calories consumed per day + Daily calorie deficit

Substituting this into our equation for total calories consumed, we get:

Calories consumed = 192 days * (x + Daily calorie deficit)

We know that Andy needs to burn a total of 105,000 calories, so we can set up the following equation:

Total calories burned = Total calories consumed
105,000 calories = 192 days * (x + Daily calorie deficit)

Solving for Daily calorie deficit, we get:

Daily calorie deficit = 105,000 calories - 192 days * x
Daily calorie deficit = 105,000 calories - 192 days * (Calories consumed per day + Daily calorie deficit)

Rearranging the equation, we get:

Calories consumed per day = (105,000 calories - 192 days * Daily calorie deficit) / 192 days

Substituting this back into our equation for total calories consumed, we get:

Calories consumed = 192 days * [(105,000 calories - 192 days * Daily calorie deficit) / 192 days]

Now we have an equation for the total number of calories consumed in terms of Daily calorie deficit. Solving for Daily calorie deficit, we get:

Daily calorie deficit = (105,000 calories - 192 days * Calories consumed per day) / 192 days

Substituting the expression we found for Calories consumed per day, we get:

Daily calorie deficit = (105,000 calories - 192 days * [(105,000 calories - 192 days * (105,000 calories - 192 days * Daily calorie deficit)) / 192 days]) / 192 days

Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let x be the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has. Then:

1. Max has x + 12 cookies (because he has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster).
2. Katarina has x + 12 - 5 = x + 7 cookies (because she has 5 less cookies than Max).
3. Summer has x + 12 + 23 = x + 35 cookies (because she has 23 more cookies than Max).

Since we cannot have half a cookie, let's round up to x = 23.

2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max.
4. Katarina has 68 cookies.

Let x be the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has. Then:

- Max has x + 12 cookies (since he has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster).
- Summer has x + 12 + 23 = x + 35 cookies (since she has 23 more cookies than Max).

Now we can create an equation to represent the total number of cookies:

x + (x + 12) + (x + 35) = 68 + 5

Solving for x:

3x + 47 = 73
3x = 26
x = 8.67 (approximately)

Since the number of cookies must be a whole number, we can round x down to 8. This means the Cookie Monster has 8 cookies.

Now we can find the number of cookies Max and Summer have:

Max = x + 12 = 8 + 12 = 20
Summer = x + 12 + 23 = 8 + 12 + 23 = 44

Finally, we can add up the number of cookies for all three people:

2. We also know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.
3. And finally, we know that Summer has 23 more cookies than Max.
4. We're given that Katarina has 68 cookies.

Let's use algebra to solve this problem:

Let x be the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
Then Max has x + 12 cookies (since he has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster).
And Summer has x + 23 + 12 = x + 35 cookies (since she has 23 more cookies than Max).

Now we can create an equation for the total number of cookies:

x (Cookie Monster) + (x + 12) (Max) + (x + 35) (Summer) = Total

Substitute the values we know:

x + x + 12 + x + 35 = 68

Combine like terms:

3x + 47 = 68

Subtract 47 from both sides:

3x = 21

Divide by 3:

x = 7

So the Cookie Monster has 7 cookies.
Max has 7 + 12 = 19 cookies.
And Summer has 7 + 23 + 12 = 42 cookies.

Now we can find the total number of cookies:

Total = x (Cookie Monster) + (x + 12) (Max) + (x + 35) (Summer)
Total = 7 + 19 + 42
Total = 68

Therefore, the total number of cookies is 68.","[""1. We know that Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max.\n2. We also know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.\n3.

2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 12 less cookies than Max.
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Max has 23 less cookies than Summer.
4. We know that Katarina has 68 cookies, which is equal to the sum of Max's, Cookie Monster's, and Summer's cookies.
5. Since Katarina = Max + Cookie Monster + Summer, and we know their respective differences, we can set up an equation:
   
   Max = Katarina - Cookie Monster - Summer + 5
   
6. Now we can substitute this equation into the original equation:
   
   Katarina = (Katarina - Cookie Monster - Summer + 5) + Cookie Monster + Summer
   
7. Solving for Katarina, we get:

Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let x be the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has. Then:

Max has x + 12 cookies
Summer has x + 12 + 23 = x + 35 cookies

Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, she has (x + 12) - 5 = x + 7 cookies. 

We know that the total number of cookies is 68, so we can set up an equation:

x (Cookie Monster) + (x + 12) (Max) + (x + 35) (Summer) + (x + 7) (Katarina) = 68

Simplify the equation:

4x + 12 + 35 + 7 = 68

Subtract 12 and 35 from both sides:

4x + 25 = 51

Subtract 25 from both sides:

4x = 26

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 6.5

20 adults * 10 lbs of potato salad per adult = 200 lbs of potato salad

5 children * (10 lbs of potato salad per adult / 2) = 25 lbs of potato salad
