      "Therefore, Liam sold 72 clips altogether in April and May.\n",
      "First, let's convert 50 minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide 50 by 60 to get 0.83 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we multiply the number of hours by Liam's hourly rate. So, 0.83 hours * $12/hour = $9.96.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, Liam earned $9.96 for 50 minutes of babysitting.\n",
      "First, let's calculate how much money Liam has already saved. Liam has half of the money he needs, so half of $100 is $50.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, let's calculate how much money Liam's grandparents gave him. Liam's parents gave him $15, and his grandparents gave him twice as much, so 2 * $15 = $30.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Liam has. Liam had already saved $50, his parents gave him $15, and his grandparents gave him $30, so $50 + $15 + $30 = $95.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, let's calculate how much more money Liam needs to buy the wallet. The wallet costs $100, and Liam has $95, so $100 - $95 = $5.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, Liam still needs $5 more to buy the wallet.\n",
      "Step 1: Calculate the number of pages Liam read today.\n",
      "Since Liam read twice as many pages as yesterday, he read 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 pages today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2: Calculate the number of remaining pages.\n",
      "The book has 120 pages, and Liam has read 12 + 24 = <<12+24=36>>36 pages so far.\n",

      "Step 3: Calculate the number of pages Liam should read tomorrow.\n",
      "Liam wants to read half of the remaining pages, so he should read 84 / 2 = <<84/2=42>>42 pages tomorrow.\n",
      "First, let's calculate how many letters Liam writes in a week. He writes 2 letters to 2 different friends, so that's 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 letters per week.\n",
      "Next, let's calculate how many pages Liam writes in a week. He writes 3 pages per letter, so that's 3 x 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 pages per week.\n",
      "Finally, let's calculate how many pages Liam writes in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so that's 12 x 52 = <<12*52=624>>624 pages per year.\n",
      "Step 1: Let's start by finding out how many purple flowers there are in Liam's garden. We know that there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers. So, if there are 10 yellow flowers, we can calculate the number of purple flowers as follows: 10 yellow flowers + 80% more = 10 + (80/100)*10 = 10 + 8 = 18 purple flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2: Now let's find out how many green flowers there are in Liam's garden. We know that there are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. So, if we add the number of yellow and purple flowers, we can calculate the number of green flowers as follows: (10 yellow flowers + 18 purple flowers) * 25% = (10 + 18) * (25/100) = 28 * 0.25 = 7 green flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3: Finally, let's calculate the total number of flowers in Liam's garden. We know that there are 10 yellow flowers, 18 purple flowers, and 7 green flowers. So the total number of flowers will be: 10 yellow flowers + 18 purple flowers + 7 green flowers = 35 flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, Liam has 35 flowers in his garden.\n",
      "First, let's calculate the total number of slices in the large pizzas. Since each large pizza has 16 slices and Liam bought 2 large pizzas, the total number of slices in the large pizzas is 16 * 2 = 32 slices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, let's calculate the total number of slices in the small pizzas. Since each small pizza has 8 slices and Liam bought 2 small pizzas, the total number of slices in the small pizzas is 8 * 2 = 16 slices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's add up the number of slices from the large and small pizzas. The total number of slices is 32 + 16 = 48 slices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, Liam would eat 48 pieces of pizza in one day if he ate all 4 pizzas.\n",
      "First, Liam placed the box on a scale and added enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds. So the weight of the box at this point is 2 pounds.\n",
      "Next, he added enough brownies to triple the weight. This means the weight of the box is now 2 pounds × 3 = 6 pounds.\n",
      "Then, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans. So the weight of the box is now 6 pounds + 2 pounds = 8 pounds.\n",
      "Finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again. This means the weight of the box is now 8 pounds × 2 = 16 pounds.\n",
      "Therefore, the final weight of the box of goodies is 16 pounds.\n",
      "First, let's add up the costs of the shirt, pants, coat, socks, and belt: $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 = $143.\n",
      "Next, let's subtract the total cost of these items from Liam's budget: $200 - $143 = $57.\n",
      "Since Liam has $16 left from his budget, we can subtract this amount from the remaining balance: $57 - $16 = $41.\n",
      "Therefore, Liam paid $41 for the shoes.\n",
      "First, we need to calculate Liam's regular pay for each day. Liam makes $18.00 per hour, so for 8 hours, he earns 8 * $18.00 = $<<8*18=144.00>>144.00.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we need to calculate Liam's overtime pay for each day. Liam works 10 hours each day, so he works 10 - 8 = 2 hours of overtime each day.\n",
      "Liam's regular hourly wage is $18.00, so his overtime rate is 1/2 * $18.00 = $<<18/2=9.00>>9.00.\n",
      "For the 2 hours of overtime, Liam earns 2 * $9.00 = $<<2*9=18.00>>18.00.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we need to calculate Liam's total pay for each day. Liam earns $144.00 in regular pay and $18.00 in overtime pay, so his total pay for each day is $144.00 + $18.00 = $<<144+18=162.00>>162.00.\n",
      "\n",
      "To find how much money Liam makes in 5 days, we multiply his total pay per day by the number of days: $162.00 * 5 = $<<162*5=810.00>>810.00.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, Liam makes $810.00 in 5 days.\n",
      "Step 1: Calculate the number of clips Noah sold in May.\n",
      "Noah sold half as many clips in May as he did in April. This means he sold 48 / 2 = <<48/2=24>>24 clips in May.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2: Calculate the total number of clips Noah sold in April and May.\n",
      "To find the total, we need to add the number of clips sold in April (48) and May (24).\n",
      "Total clips sold = 48 + 24 = <<48+24=72>>72\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, Noah sold a total of 72 clips in April and May.\n",
      "To find out how much Noah earned, we need to calculate his earnings per minute of babysitting and then multiply it by the total number of minutes he worked.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we need to convert his hourly wage to a minute wage. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide his hourly wage by 60 to get his earnings per minute: $12 / 60 = $0.20 per minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we multiply his earnings per minute by the total number of minutes he worked: $0.20 * 50 = $10.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, Noah earned $10 for 50 minutes of babysitting.\n",
      "Step 1: Noah needs $100 for the new wallet.\n",
      "Step 2: Noah has half of the money he needs, which is $100/2 = $50.\n",
      "Step 3: Noah's parents gave him $15, so he now has $50 + $15 = $65.\n",
      "Step 4: Noah's grandparents gave him twice as much as his parents, which is $15 * 2 = $30.\n",
      "Step 5: With the money from his grandparents, Noah now has $65 + $30 = $95.\n",
      "Step 6: Noah needs $100 for the wallet, but he only has $95, so he still needs $100 - $95 = $5 more.\n",
      "Step 1: Calculate the number of pages Noah has left to read.\n",
      "Noah has a 120-page book and has already read 12 pages, so he has 120 - 12 = <<120-12=108>>108 pages left to read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2: Calculate the number of pages Noah read today.\n",
      "Noah read twice as many pages today as he did yesterday, so he read 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 pages today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3: Calculate the number of pages Noah will have left to read after today.\n",
      "After reading 24 pages today, Noah will have 108 - 24 = <<108-24=84>>84 pages left to read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 4: Calculate the number of pages Noah wants to read tomorrow.\n",
      "Noah wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, so he wants to read 84 / 2 = <<84/2=42>>42 pages tomorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, Noah should read 42 pages tomorrow.\n",
      "Step 1: Calculate the number of letters Noah writes in a week.\n",
      "Noah writes a letter to 2 different friends twice a week, so the total number of letters he writes in a week is 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2: Calculate the number of pages Noah writes in a week.\n",
      "Each letter Noah writes is 3 pages long, so the total number of pages he writes in a week is 4 * 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3: Calculate the number of pages Noah writes in a year.\n",
      "There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of pages Noah writes in a year is 12 * 52 = <<12*52=624>>624 pages.\n",
      "Step 1: Let's start by finding out how many purple flowers Noah has. We know that there are 80% more yellow flowers than purple flowers. So, if there are 10 yellow flowers, we can calculate the number of purple flowers as follows: 10 yellow flowers * 80% = 8 purple flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2: Now, let's find out how many yellow and purple flowers there are in total. We know that there are 10 yellow flowers and 8 purple flowers. So, the total number of yellow and purple flowers is 10 yellow flowers + 8 purple flowers = 18 flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3: Next, we need to find out how many green flowers there are. We know that there are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. So, we can calculate the number of green flowers as follows: 18 flowers * 25% = 4.5 green flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 4: Since we cannot have a fraction of a flower, we need to round up the number of green flowers to the nearest whole number. So, Noah has 5 green flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 5: Finally, let's calculate the total number of flowers in Noah's garden. We know that there are 10 yellow flowers, 8 purple flowers, and 5 green flowers. So, the total number of flowers is 10 yellow flowers + 8 purple flowers + 5 green flowers = 23 flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, Noah has 23 flowers in his garden.\n",
      "Sure! Let's break it down step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's find out how many slices are in the large pizzas. Since each large pizza has 16 slices, we can multiply that by the number of large pizzas Noah bought. In this case, he bought 2 large pizzas, so the total number of slices from the large pizzas is 16 slices/pizza * 2 pizzas = 32 slices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, let's calculate the number of slices in the small pizzas. Since each small pizza has 8 slices, we can multiply that by the number of small pizzas Noah bought. In this case, he bought 2 small pizzas, so the total number of slices from the small pizzas is 8 slices/pizza * 2 pizzas = 16 slices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's add up the number of slices from the large and small pizzas. Noah ate 32 slices from the large pizzas + 16 slices from the small pizzas = 48 slices in total.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, if Noah eats all the pizzas he bought, he would eat 48 pieces that day.\n",
      "Step 1: Noah poured in enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.\n",
      "Step 2: Noah added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple. So, the weight became 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.\n",
      "Step 3: Noah added another 2 pounds of jelly beans. So, the weight became 6 + 2 = 8 pounds.\n",
      "Step 4: Noah added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again. So, the weight became 8 * 2 = 16 pounds.\n",
      "Therefore, the final weight of the box of goodies is 16 pounds.\n",
      "Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the items Noah purchased.\n",
      "The cost of the shirt is $30.\n",
      "The cost of the suit pants is $46.\n",
      "The cost of the suit coat is $38.\n",
      "The cost of the socks is $11.\n",
      "The cost of the belt is $18.\n",
      "So the total cost is $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 = $143.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2: Calculate the remaining budget after purchasing the items.\n",
      "Noah had a budget of $200 and spent $143, so the remaining budget is $200 - $143 = $57.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3: Calculate the cost of the shoes.\n",
      "Noah has $16 left from the remaining budget of $57, so the cost of the shoes must be $57 - $16 = $41.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, Noah paid $41 for the shoes.\n",
      "To calculate Noah's earnings, we need to consider his regular hours and overtime hours separately.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's calculate his regular hours earnings:\n",
      "Noah's regular hourly wage is $18.00 per hour, and he works 8 hours per day for 5 days, so his regular hours earnings would be:\n",
      "Regular hours earnings = $18.00/hour * 8 hours/day * 5 days/week\n",
      "Regular hours earnings = $144.00/day * 5 days/week\n",
      "Regular hours earnings = $720.00/week\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, let's calculate his overtime hours earnings:\n",
      "Noah works 10 hours every day for 5 days, and his overtime rate is 1.5 times his regular hourly wage. So, his overtime hours earnings would be:\n",
      "Overtime hours earnings = ($18.00/hour * 1.5) * (10 hours/day * 5 days/week)\n",
      "Overtime hours earnings = $27.00/hour * 50 hours/week\n",
      "Overtime hours earnings = $1350.00/week\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, let's calculate his total earnings:\n",
      "Total earnings = Regular hours earnings + Overtime hours earnings\n",
      "Total earnings = $720.00/week + $1350.00/week\n",
      "Total earnings = $2070.00/week\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, Noah would make $2070.00 per week if he worked 10 hours every day for 5 days.\n",
      "First, let's find out how many clips William sold in May. To do this, we divide the number of clips sold in April by 2: 48 clips / 2 = 24 clips.\n",

      "Next, we can add the number of clips sold in April and May together: 48 clips + 24 clips = 72 clips.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, William sold a total of 72 clips in April and May.\n",
      "First, let's convert the 50 minutes into hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 50 minutes is equal to 50/60 = 0.83 hours.\n",

      "Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Markus has saved. We need to add the money he had before ($50) with the money his parents gave him ($15) and the money his grandparents gave him ($30). So the total amount Markus has saved is $50 + $15 + $30 = $95.\n",
      "Finally, let's calculate how much more money Markus needs to buy the wallet. The wallet costs $100, and Markus has saved $95, so he still needs $100 - $95 = $5 more.\n",
      "First, let's calculate how many pages Markus read today. Since he read twice as many pages as yesterday, he read 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 pages today.\n",

      "First, we need to calculate how many pages Markus writes in a week. To do this, we multiply the number of letters he writes per week by the number of pages in each letter.

      "So, Markus writes 624 pages in a year.\n",
      "Let's start by finding the number of purple flowers. We know that there are 80% more yellow flowers than purple flowers. So if there are 10 yellow flowers, there are 80/100 * 10 = 8 more purple flowers.\n",
      "This means there are a total of 10 + 8 = 18 purple flowers.\n",
      "Next, we need to find the number of green flowers. We know that there are 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. So if there are 10 + 18 = 28 yellow and purple flowers, there are 25/100 * 28 = 7 green flowers.\n",
      "Finally, we can find the total number of flowers in Markus's garden by adding up the number of yellow, purple, and green flowers. So the total number of flowers is 10 + 18 + 7 = 35.\n",
      "First, let's calculate the number of slices in the large pizzas. Since each large pizza has 16 slices and Markus bought 2 large pizzas, he has 16 x 2 = 32 slices from the large pizzas.\n",

      "Next, let's calculate how much Markus makes for his overtime hours. He works 10 hours per day, which means he works 10 - 8 = 2 hours of overtime per day.\n",
      "His overtime rate is his regular hourly wage + 1/2 his regular hourly wage, so his overtime rate is $18.00 + $18.00/2 = $18.00 + $9.00 = $27.00 per hour.\n",
      "Therefore, Markus makes 2 * $27.00 = $<<2*27=54.00>>54.00 per day for his overtime hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's calculate how much Markus makes in total per day. His regular pay is $144.00 and his overtime pay is $54.00, so his total daily pay is $144.00 + $54.00 = $<<144+54=198.00>>198.00.\n",

      "   10 yellow flowers + (10 yellow flowers * 0.80) = 10 yellow flowers + 8 purple flowers = 18 purple flowers\n",

      "First, let's find out how much money Olivia currently has. We know that she has only half of the money she needs, which means she has $100 / 2 = $50.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we need to calculate how much money Olivia's grandparents give her. We know that her grandparents give her twice as much as her parents, so that means they give her $15 x 2 = $30.\n",

      "Next, we need to find out how many pages are remaining in the book. The book has 120 pages, and Olivia has already read 36 pages, so the number of remaining pages is 120 - 36 = <<120-36=84>>84 pages.\n",
      "Finally, Olivia wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow. Half of 84 pages is 84 / 2 = <<84/2=42>>42 pages.\n",
      "Therefore, Olivia should read 42 pages tomorrow.\n",
      "First, we need to calculate the number of letters Olivia writes in a year. \n",
      "Since she writes to 2 different friends twice a week, she writes a total of 2 x 2 = 4 letters per week.\n",

      "Green flowers = 0.25 * Total yellow and purple flowers = 0.25 * 2.8 * Yellow flowers = 0.7 * Yellow flowers\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 4: Calculate the total number of flowers in Olivia's garden.\n",
      "Total flowers = Yellow flowers + Purple flowers + Green flowers = Yellow flowers + 1.8 * Yellow flowers + 0.7 * Yellow flowers = 3.5 * Yellow flowers\n",

      "Next, let's calculate how much Olivia had left from her budget after buying the clothes. Her budget was $200, and she spent $143 on clothes. So, she has $200 - $143 = $<<200-143=57>>57 left.\n",
      "Since Olivia spent $16 of the remaining budget on the shoes, the cost of the shoes must be $57 - $16 = $<<57-16=41>>41. \n",

      "Overtime pay = ($18.00/hour + $9.00/hour) * 2 hours\n",
      "Overtime pay = ($27.00/hour) * 2 hours\n",

      "Next, let's calculate Ava's overtime wages for each day:\n",
      "For any hours worked beyond 8 hours, Ava is eligible for overtime pay. Overtime pay is her hourly wage plus half her hourly wage, so it's calculated as:\n",

      "First, we need to find out how many clips Isabella sold in May. We know that she sold half as many clips in May as she did in April. Since she sold 48 clips in April, she sold 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 clips in May.\n",
      "To find out how many clips Isabella sold altogether in April and May, we add the number of clips sold in each month: 48 + 24 = <<48+24=72>>72.\n",

      "Next, we need to calculate the total number of pages Austyn writes in a year. Since each letter is 3 pages long, we can multiply the number of letters by the number of pages per letter. Therefore, we have 104 letters/year * 3 pages/letter = 312 pages/year.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, Austyn writes 312 pages in a year.\n",
      "Step 1: Let's start by finding out how many purple flowers Austyn has in her garden. We know that there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers. So, we can calculate 80% of the number of yellow flowers:\n",
      "80% of 10 yellow flowers = 0.8 * 10 = 8 purple flowers\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2: Now, let's find out how many green flowers Austyn has in her garden. We know that there are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. So, we can calculate 25% of the total number of yellow and purple flowers:\n",
      "25% of (10 yellow flowers + 8 purple flowers) = 0.25 * (10 + 8) = 0.25 * 18 = 4.5 green flowers\n",
      "\n",
      "Since we can't have half of a flower, we can assume that Austyn has either 4 or 5 green flowers in her garden. Let's assume she has 4 green flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3: Finally, let's calculate the total number of flowers in Austyn's garden. We know that Austyn has 10 yellow flowers, 8 purple flowers, and 4 green flowers:\n",
      "Total number of flowers = 10 yellow flowers + 8 purple flowers + 4 green flowers = 22 flowers\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, Austyn has a total of 22 flowers in her garden.\n",
      "Sure! Let's break it down step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's calculate the number of slices in the large pizzas. Since each large pizza has 16 slices, we multiply 16 by the number of large pizzas, which is 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "16 slices/pizza * 2 pizzas = 32 slices from the large pizzas\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, let's calculate the number of slices in the small pizzas. Since each small pizza has 8 slices, we multiply 8 by the number of small pizzas, which is also 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "8 slices/pizza * 2 pizzas = 16 slices from the small pizzas\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's add the number of slices from the large pizzas and the small pizzas together to find the total number of slices Austyn can eat in one day.\n",
      "\n",
      "32 slices + 16 slices = 48 slices\n",
      "\n",
      "So, Austyn can eat 48 pizza slices in one day if she eats all 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas.\n",
      "Step 1: Austyn added enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.\n",
      "Step 2: Austyn added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple. This means the weight of the box is now 2 x 3 = 6 pounds.\n",
      "Step 3: Austyn added another 2 pounds of jelly beans. The weight of the box is now 6 + 2 = 8 pounds.\n",
      "Step 4: Austyn added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again. This means the weight of the box is now 8 x 2 = 16 pounds.\n",
      "Therefore, the final weight of the box of goodies is 16 pounds.\n",
      "First, let's calculate the total amount spent on all the items Austyn purchased. \n",
      "\n",
      "She spent $30 on a button-up shirt + $46 on suit pants + $38 on a suit coat + $11 on socks + $18 on a belt = $143.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, let's subtract the total amount spent from her budget to find out how much is left.\n",
      "\n",
      "$200 (budget) - $143 (total spent) = $57 (remaining amount).\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Austyn has $16 left from her budget, we can subtract this amount from the remaining amount to find out how much she spent on the shoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "$57 (remaining amount) - $16 (leftover) = $41.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, Austyn paid $41 for the shoes.\n",
      "First, let's calculate the regular pay for Austyn. If she works 8 hours per day for 5 days, her regular pay would be 8 hours/day x 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.\n",
      "At $18.00 per hour, her regular pay for the week would be $18.00/hour x 40 hours = $<<18*40=720.00>>720.00.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, let's calculate the overtime pay for Austyn. For every hour of overtime, she would be paid her hourly wage plus half her hourly wage. So, for 2 hours of overtime per day for 5 days, the overtime pay would be (2 hours/day x $18.00/hour) + (1/2 * 2 hours/day x $18.00/hour) = $36.00 + $18.00 = $54.00/day.\n",
      "For 5 days, the total overtime pay would be $54.00/day x 5 days/week = $<<54*5=270.00>>270.00.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, let's calculate Austyn's total earnings for the week. Her total earnings would be her regular pay plus her overtime pay, so the total would be $720.00 + $270.00 = $<<720+270=990.00>>990.00.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, Austyn would make $990.00 in one week if she worked 10 hours every day for 5 days.\n"
