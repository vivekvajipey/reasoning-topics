      "First, let's calculate how much money Nik has saved up in total from his allowance. He gets $5 a month, and he has been saving for 3 months, so he has saved up $5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, let's calculate how much money Nik has earned from mowing lawns. He charges $15 per lawn, and he has mowed 4 lawns, so he has earned $15 x 4 = $<<15*4=60>>60.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's calculate how much money Nik has earned from shoveling driveways. He charges $7 per driveway, and we don't know how many driveways he shoveled, so let's call the number of driveways x. Therefore, he has earned $7x from shoveling driveways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's calculate how much money Nik has in total before buying the shoes. He has saved up $15, earned $60 from mowing lawns, and earned $7x from shoveling driveways. Therefore, he has $15 + $60 + $7x = $75 + $7x.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, let's calculate how much money Nik has left after buying the shoes. He had $75 + $7x in total, and he spent $95 on the shoes, so he has $75 + $7x - $95 = $-20 + $7x.\n",
      "\n",
      "We know that after buying the shoes, Nik has $15 in change, so $-20 + $7x = $15.\n",

      "To solve for x, we can add $20 to both sides of the equation: $-20 + $7x + $20 = $15 + $20.\n",

      "This simplifies to $7x = $35.\n",

      "First, let's calculate how much money Nik has saved up in total from his allowance. He gets $5 a month, and he has been saving for 3 months, so he has saved up $5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, let's calculate how much money Nik has earned from mowing lawns. He charges $15 per lawn, and he has mowed 4 lawns, so he has earned $15 x 4 = $<<15*4=60>>60.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's calculate how much money Nik has earned from shoveling driveways. He charges $7 per driveway, and we don't know how many driveways he shoveled, so let's call the number of driveways x. Therefore, he has earned $7x from shoveling driveways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's calculate how much money Nik has in total before buying the shoes. He has saved up $15, earned $60 from mowing lawns, and earned $7x from shoveling driveways. Therefore, he has $15 + $60 + $7x = $75 + $7x.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, let's calculate how much money Nik has left after buying the shoes. He had $75 + $7x in total, and he spent $95 on the shoes, so he has $75 + $7x - $95 = $-20 + $7x.\n",
      "\n",
      "We know that after buying the shoes, Nik has $15 in change, so $-20 + $7x = $15.\n",
      "\n",
      "To solve for x, we can add $20 to both sides of the equation: $-20 + $7x + $20 = $15 + $20.\n",
      "\n",
      "This simplifies to $7x = $35.\n",
      "\n",

      "Step 7: Calculate the number of driveways Nik shoveled.\n",
      "Nik charges $7 to shovel a driveway, and he earned $20 from shoveling driveways.\n",
      "Number of driveways shoveled = Total money earned from shoveling driveways / Amount charged per driveway\n",
      "Number of driveways shoveled = $20 / $7 = 2.857\n",
      "Since Nik cannot shovel a fraction of a driveway, we can round down to the nearest whole number.\n",

      "First, let's calculate how long Iminathi practices the violin each day. Since she practices the piano for 20 minutes a day and the violin for three times as long, she practices the violin for 20 * 3 = <<20*3=60>>60 minutes a day.\n",

      "Finally, let's calculate how long Iminathi practices in a month. Since there are four weeks in a month, she practices the piano for 120 * 4 = <<120*4=480>>480 minutes in a month.\n",
