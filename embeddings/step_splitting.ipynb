      "5. Adding the money from her grandparents, Betty now has $65 + $30 = $95.\n",
      "6. To find out how much more money Betty needs, we subtract the amount she already has from the cost of the wallet: $100 - $95 = $5.\n",

      "First, let's add up the costs of the items Alexis did buy. \n",

      "\n",
      "Next, let's calculate Tina's overtime pay for working 2 extra hours per day. Her overtime pay is calculated as her hourly wage + 1/2 her hourly wage. So, her overtime pay per hour is $18.00 + $18.00/2 = $18.00 + $9.00 = $27.00.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tina works 2 extra hours per day for 5 days, so her overtime pay per day is 2 hours x $27.00/hour = $54.00.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's calculate Tina's total pay for working 10 hours per day for 5 days. Her regular pay is $144.00 per day x 5 days = $720.00. Her overtime pay is $54.00 per day x 5 days = $270.00.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, let's add Tina's regular pay and overtime pay to find her total pay for the week. Her total pay is $720.00 + $270.00 = $990.00.\n",

      "First, let's calculate the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the third hundred years. We know that each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship.

      "\n",
      "Now, we also know that over three hundred years, the monster has consumed 847 people. So, the number of people on the ship in the third hundred years plus the number of people on the ship in the second hundred years plus the number of people on the ship in the first hundred years equals 847.\n",

      "Let's denote the number of people on the ship in the first hundred years as y. So, we can write the equation as:\n",

      "First, let's calculate how much money Tobias has saved up in total. He has been saving for 3 months and receives a $5 allowance each month, so he has saved 3 * $5 = $<<3*5=15>>15 from his allowance.\n",

      "Next, let's calculate how much money Tobias has earned from mowing lawns. He charges $15 per lawn and he mowed 4 lawns, so he has earned 15 * 4 = $<<15*4=60>>60 from mowing lawns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's calculate how much money Tobias has earned from shoveling driveways. We know that he has $15 in change after buying the shoes, so the total amount of money he had before buying the shoes was $95 + $15 = $<<95+15=110>>110. Therefore, he has earned $110 - $15 = $<<110-15=95>>95 from mowing lawns and allowance combined.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Tobias earned $95 from mowing lawns and allowance combined, and $60 from mowing lawns, the remaining amount must have come from shoveling driveways. Therefore, Tobias earned $95 - $60 = $<<95-60=35>>35 from shoveling driveways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, let's calculate how many driveways Tobias shoveled. We know that he charges $7 per driveway, so he shoveled $35 / $7 = <<35/7=5>>5 driveways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, Tobias shoveled 5 driveways.\n",

      "First, let's find out how many pages Joy can read in 1 minute. We can do this by dividing the number of pages she can read in 20 minutes by 20. So, Joy can read 8/20 = 0.4 pages in 1 minute.\n",

      "Now, let's find out how many minutes it will take Joy to read 120 pages. We can do this by dividing 120 by 0.4. So, it will take Joy 120/0.4 = 300 minutes to read 120 pages.\n",

      "Finally, let's convert the minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so 300 minutes is equal to 300/60 = 5 hours.\n",

      "Now, let's calculate James' profit per DVD. The profit per DVD is the selling price minus the production cost, which is $15 - $6 = $<<15-6=9>>9.\n",

      "Now, let's calculate James' profit per week. He sells movies for 5 days a week, so his profit per week is 5 * $4500 = $<<5*4500=22500>>22500.\n",

      "Finally, let's calculate James' profit per 20 weeks. His profit per 20 weeks is 20 * $22500 = $<<20*22500=450000>>450000.\n",

      "Finally, let's divide the total number of bananas by the number of monkeys to find out how many bananas each monkey would get. There are 12 monkeys in the family, so each monkey would get 1836 / 12 = 153 bananas.\n",
      "Let's start by determining the number of buildings that collapsed in the first earthquake. Since it is not specified in the question, we will assume that the number of buildings that collapsed in the first earthquake is X.\n",
