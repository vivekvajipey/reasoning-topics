Label: Identifying the Regular Hourly Wage: "First, let's calculate Tina's regular hourly wage:

Regular Hourly Wage = Hourly Wage
= $18.00/hour , " Tina's hourly wage is $18.00. , "First, let's calculate Tina's regular hourly wage:
Regular Hourly Wage = Tina's hourly rate * Hours worked per shift
Regular Hourly Wage = $18.00/hour * 8 hours/shift = $144/shift , "First, let's calculate Tina's standard hourly wage:

Standard Hourly Wage = $18.00 , "First, let's calculate Tina's normal hourly wage. She makes $18.00 per hour. 
"Calculating the Total Overtime Hours Worked":  Next, let's calculate the amount of overtime Tina earns:

Overtime Hours = Total Hours Worked - Regular Hours Worked
= (10 hours/day * 5 days) - 8 hours/shift
= 40 hours - 8 hours
= 32 hours 
"Calculating the Overtime Pay":  Now, let's calculate the overtime pay:

Overtime Pay = Overtime Hours * (Regular Hourly Wage + 1/2 Regular Hourly Wage)
= 32 hours * ($18.00/hour + $9.00/hour)
= 32 hours * $27.00/hour
= $864.00 ,  Next, let's calculate her overtime pay rate:

Overtime Pay Rate = Standard Hourly Wage + 1/2 Standard Hourly Wage
Overtime Pay Rate = $18.00 + 1/2 * $18.00
Overtime Pay Rate = $18.00 + $9.00
Overtime Pay Rate = $27.00 
"Calculating Total Earnings by Adding Regular Hourly Wage and Overtime Pay":  Finally, let's add Tina's regular hourly wage and overtime pay to find her total earnings:

Total Earnings = Regular Hourly Wage + Overtime Pay
= $18.00/hour + $864.00
= $882.00 
Label: Stating the final answer:  So, Tina makes $882.00 in 5 days.",  So, Tina made a total of $927.00."
Describing the overtime pay calculation rule:  If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by her hourly wage + 1/2 her hourly wage. , " Tina earns $18.00 per hour and works more than 8 hours per shift, which means she is eligible for overtime. 
"Calculating the Overtime Pay Rate":  So, let's calculate the overtime pay:

Overtime pay = (Tina's hourly wage) + (1/2 * Tina's hourly wage)
= $18.00 + (1/2 * $18.00)
= $18.00 + $9.00
= $27.00 
"Calculating total hours worked by Tina in a week":  Tina works 10 hours every day for 5 days, so she works a total of 50 hours. ,  If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, then:

1. Her total hours worked in a week are 10 hours/day x 5 days/week = 50 hours/week. 
Determining eligibility for overtime pay:  Since 50 hours is more than 8 hours, she is eligible for overtime pay. ,  Since Tina works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime. 
"Calculating total daily earnings based on overtime pay rate":  Therefore, Tina makes a total of $27.00 + $27.00 = $54.00."
"Calculating Overtime Pay per Shift":  Let's calculate the overtime pay:
Overtime Pay = Regular Hourly Wage + 1/2 Regular Hourly Wage
Overtime Pay = $144/shift + 1/2 * $144/shift = $216/shift 
"Calculating Daily Earnings Including Overtime":  Now, let's calculate Tina's total earnings for each day:
Daily Earnings = Regular Hourly Wage * Hours worked per day + Overtime Pay * Overtime hours worked per day
Daily Earnings = $144/shift * 5 days = $720 + $216/shift * 5 days = $1080 
"Calculating Total Earnings for the Week":  Finally, let's find Tina's total earnings for the 5 days:
Total Earnings = Daily Earnings * Number of days
Total Earnings = $1080 * 5 = $5400

So, Tina makes $5400 over 5 days if she works 10 hours every day."
"Calculating Total Overtime Pay for the Week":  Now, let's calculate the total amount of overtime pay Tina will receive for working 10 hours each day for 5 days:

Total Overtime Pay = Overtime Pay Rate * Total Overtime Hours
Total Overtime Pay = $27.00/hour * 50 hours
Total Overtime Pay = $1,350.00 
"Calculating total weekly earnings by adding standard pay and overtime pay":  Finally, let's calculate Tina's total earnings for the week:

Total Earnings = Standard Hourly Wage * Standard Hours + Total Overtime Pay
Total Earnings = $18.00/hour * 40 hours + $1,350.00
Total Earnings = $720.00 + $1,350.00
Total Earnings = $2,070.00 
Providing the final answer to the problem:  So, Tina will make $2,070.00 for working 10 hours each day for 5 days."
"Calculating Daily Wage without Overtime": "First, let's calculate Tina's daily wage without considering overtime:

Daily wage = Hourly wage * Hours worked per day
= $18.00 * 10 hours
= $180.00 , "First, let's calculate Tina's daily wage:

1. Tina makes $18.00 per hour.
2. She works 10 hours every day.
3. Therefore, her daily wage is:

Daily wage = Hourly wage * Hours worked
= $18.00 * 10
= $180.00 , "First, let's calculate how much Tina would make from working 10 hours every day for 5 days without considering overtime:

Regular pay = Hourly wage x Hours worked per day x Days worked
= $18.00 x 10 x 5
= $900.00 
"Calculating Weekly Wage without Overtime":  Next, let's calculate her weekly wage without considering overtime:

Weekly wage = Daily wage * Days worked per week
= $180.00 * 5 days
= $900.00 ,  Now, let's calculate Tina's weekly wage:

1. Tina works for 5 days every week.
2. Therefore, her weekly wage is:

Weekly wage = Daily wage * Days worked
= $180.00 * 5
= $900.00 
"Calculating Overtime Wage":  Now, let's calculate her overtime wage. Tina works more than 8 hours per shift, so she is eligible for overtime. Overtime is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage. In this case, her overtime wage is:

Overtime wage = (Hourly wage + 1/2 hourly wage) * Hours worked over 8
= ($18.00 + $9.00) * 2
= $27.00 * 2
= $54.00 ,  However, since she works more than 8 hours per shift and is eligible for overtime, we need to calculate the overtime pay as well.

Overtime pay = Hourly wage x (Hours worked per day - 8) x Days worked
= $18.00 x (10 - 8) x 5
= $18.00 x 2 x 5
= $90.00 
"Calculating Total Weekly Wage by Adding Daily Wage and Overtime Wage":  Finally, let's add her daily wage and overtime wage to find her total weekly wage:

Total weekly wage = Daily wage + Overtime wage
= $180.00 + $54.00
= $234.00 ,  Finally, we add the regular pay and the overtime pay to find Tina's total earnings:

Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay
= $900.00 + $90.00
= $990.00 
Label: Concluding the total weekly wage calculation:  So, Tina makes $234.00 per week.",  So, Tina makes $900.00 per week.

Note that this assumes Tina does not work any overtime. If she does work overtime, her hourly wage would be increased by 1/2 her hourly wage, and she would be paid for the extra hours worked.",  So, Tina would make $990.00 from working 10 hours every day for 5 days, including overtime."
"Determining Overtime Hours Worked":  2. To calculate her overtime pay, we need to find the difference between her total hours worked and the standard 40-hour workweek: 50 hours - 40 hours = 10 hours. 
"Calculating Overtime Hourly Wage":  3. Overtime pay is calculated by adding 1/2 of her hourly wage to her regular hourly wage: 18.00 + 1/2 x 18.00 = 27.00/hour. 
"Calculating Total Overtime Pay":  4. Since she worked 10 hours of overtime, her overtime pay is 10 hours x 27.00/hour = $270. 
"Calculating Total Weekly Earnings Including Overtime Pay":  5. To find her total weekly earnings, we add her regular hourly wage to her overtime pay: 18.00/hour x 40 hours/week + 270 = 720.

So, Tina makes $720 per week if she works 10 hours every day for 5 days."
"Determining Total Weekly Work Hours":  Next, we need to determine how much overtime pay she is eligible for. Since she works more than 8 hours per shift and there are 5 days in a week, she works a total of 40 hours per week. 
"Calculating Overtime Pay Rate":  To calculate her overtime pay, we add 1/2 her hourly wage to her normal hourly wage. So, her overtime pay would be (1/2)*$18.00 = $9.00 per hour. ,  First, let's calculate her overtime pay:
Overtime pay = 18.00 + 1/2 \* 18.00
Overtime pay = 27.00 
"Formulating the equation for total weekly wage including overtime":  Now, we can calculate her total weekly wage by multiplying her normal hourly wage by the number of hours she works per week (including overtime). 
Total weekly wage = (Normal hourly wage)*(Hours per week) + (Overtime wage)*(Hours per week) 
"Calculating Total Weekly Wage by Substituting Values into the Formula":  Plugging in the values, we get:
Total weekly wage = ($18.00)*(40) + ($9.00)*(40) = $720 + $360 = $1,080

So, Tina makes a total of $1,080 per week if she works 10 hours every day for 5 days."
Label: Identifying and summarizing the problem details: "Let's break down the problem:

1. Tina makes $18.00 an hour.
2. If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime.
3. Overtime pay is calculated as your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.
4. Tina worked 10 hours every day for 5 days. 
"Calculating Total Pay by Adding Regular Pay and Overtime Pay":  Now, let's add this to her regular pay to find out how much money she made in total:
Regular pay = 18.00 \* 5 \* 10 = 900.00
Total pay = Regular pay + Overtime pay
Total pay = 900.00 + 27.00
Total pay = 927.00
