Label: Calculation of Regular Hourly Wage: First, let's calculate Tina's regular hourly wage:

Regular Hourly Wage = Hourly Wage
= $18.00/hour
, Tina's hourly wage is $18.00. , First, let's calculate Tina's standard hourly wage:

Standard Hourly Wage = $18.00

, 
Now, let's calculate her overtime wage. Tina works more than 8 hours per shift, so she is eligible for overtime. Overtime is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage. In this case, her overtime wage is:

Overtime wage = (Hourly wage + 1/2 hourly wage) * Hours worked over 8
= ($18.00 + $9.00) * 2
= $27.00 * 2
= $54.00
,  1. Tina makes $18.00 per hour. ,  Daily wage = Hourly wage * Hours worked , Tina earns $18.00 per hour and works more than 8 hours per shift, which means she is eligible for overtime. ,  If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, then: ,  3. Overtime pay is calculated by adding 1/2 of her hourly wage to her regular hourly wage: 18.00 + 1/2 x 18.00 = 27.00/hour. ,  However, since she works more than 8 hours per shift and is eligible for overtime, we need to calculate the overtime pay as well. ,  3. To calculate her overtime pay, we add 1/2 her hourly wage to her normal hourly wage. So, her overtime pay would be (1/2)*$18.00 = $9.00 per hour. ,  3. Overtime pay is calculated as your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage. , 

First, let's calculate her overtime pay: ,  Overtime pay = 18.00 + 1/2 \* 18.00 ,  Overtime pay = 27.00 
Calculating Overtime Hours: 
Next, let's calculate the amount of overtime Tina earns:

Overtime Hours = Total Hours Worked - Regular Hours Worked
= (10 hours/day * 5 days) - 8 hours/shift
= 40 hours - 8 hours
= 32 hours

Calculating Overtime Pay: 
Now, let's calculate the overtime pay:

Overtime Pay = Overtime Hours * (Regular Hourly Wage + 1/2 Regular Hourly Wage)
= 32 hours * ($18.00/hour + $9.00/hour)
= 32 hours * $27.00/hour
= $864.00
, 

Next, let's calculate her overtime pay rate:

Overtime Pay Rate = Standard Hourly Wage + 1/2 Standard Hourly Wage
Overtime Pay Rate = $18.00 + 1/2 * $18.00
Overtime Pay Rate = $18.00 + $9.00
Overtime Pay Rate = $27.00


Label: Calculation of Total Earnings: 
Finally, let's add Tina's regular hourly wage and overtime pay to find her total earnings:

Total Earnings = Regular Hourly Wage + Overtime Pay
= $18.00/hour + $864.00
= $882.00
,  Finally, we add the regular pay and the overtime pay to find Tina's total earnings: ,  Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay , 

Now, let's add this to her regular pay to find out how much money she made in total: ,  Total pay = Regular pay + Overtime pay , 

So, Tina made a total of $927.00.
Final Total Earnings: 
So, Tina makes $882.00 in 5 days.
Explanation of Overtime Pay Calculation:  If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by her hourly wage + 1/2 her hourly wage. ,  So, let's calculate the overtime pay: ,  Overtime pay = (Tina's hourly wage) + (1/2 * Tina's hourly wage) ,  = $18.00 + (1/2 * $18.00) ,  = $18.00 + $9.00 ,  = $27.00 
Calculation of Total Hours Worked:  Tina works 10 hours every day for 5 days, so she works a total of 50 hours. , 
2. Since Tina works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime.
,  1. Her total hours worked in a week are 10 hours/day x 5 days/week = 50 hours/week. ,  2. To calculate her overtime pay, we need to find the difference between her total hours worked and the standard 40-hour workweek: 50 hours - 40 hours = 10 hours. ,  4. Since she worked 10 hours of overtime, her overtime pay is 10 hours x 27.00/hour = $270. ,  2. If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime. ,  Total pay = 927.00 
Determining eligibility for overtime pay based on total hours worked.:  Since 50 hours is more than 8 hours, she is eligible for overtime pay. 
Incorrect calculation of total earnings:  Therefore, Tina makes a total of $27.00 + $27.00 = $<<27+27=54>>54.00.
Calculating regular earnings per shift: 1. First, let's calculate Tina's regular hourly wage:
Regular Hourly Wage = Tina's hourly rate * Hours worked per shift
Regular Hourly Wage = $18.00/hour * 8 hours/shift = $144/shift

Calculation of Overtime Pay per Shift: 
3. Let's calculate the overtime pay:
Overtime Pay = Regular Hourly Wage + 1/2 Regular Hourly Wage
Overtime Pay = $144/shift + 1/2 * $144/shift = $216/shift

Calculating total daily earnings based on regular and overtime pay.: 
4. Now, let's calculate Tina's total earnings for each day:
Daily Earnings = Regular Hourly Wage * Hours worked per day + Overtime Pay * Overtime hours worked per day
Daily Earnings = $144/shift * 5 days = $720 + $216/shift * 5 days = $1080

Calculating total earnings for 5 days: 
5. Finally, let's find Tina's total earnings for the 5 days:
Total Earnings = Daily Earnings * Number of days
Total Earnings = $1080 * 5 = $5400
, 
So, Tina makes $5400 over 5 days if she works 10 hours every day.,  Weekly wage = Daily wage * Days worked 
Calculation of total overtime pay for the week: 

Now, let's calculate the total amount of overtime pay Tina will receive for working 10 hours each day for 5 days:

Total Overtime Pay = Overtime Pay Rate * Total Overtime Hours
Total Overtime Pay = $27.00/hour * 50 hours
Total Overtime Pay = $1,350.00


Calculating Total Weekly Earnings: 

Finally, let's calculate Tina's total earnings for the week:

Total Earnings = Standard Hourly Wage * Standard Hours + Total Overtime Pay
Total Earnings = $18.00/hour * 40 hours + $1,350.00
Total Earnings = $720.00 + $1,350.00
Total Earnings = $2,070.00

, 

So, Tina will make $2,070.00 for working 10 hours each day for 5 days.,  Now, let's calculate Tina's weekly wage: ,  2. Therefore, her weekly wage is: ,  5. To find her total weekly earnings, we add her regular hourly wage to her overtime pay: 18.00/hour x 40 hours/week + 270 = 720. ,  Regular pay = Hourly wage x Hours worked per day x Days worked 
Calculating daily wage without overtime: First, let's calculate Tina's daily wage without considering overtime:

Daily wage = Hourly wage * Hours worked per day
= $18.00 * 10 hours
= $180.00

Calculating weekly wage without overtime: 
Next, let's calculate her weekly wage without considering overtime:

Weekly wage = Daily wage * Days worked per week
= $180.00 * 5 days
= $900.00
,  = $180.00 * 5 ,  = $900.00 ,  So, Tina makes $900.00 per week. , First, let's calculate how much Tina would make from working 10 hours every day for 5 days without considering overtime: ,  = $18.00 x 10 x 5 ,  = $900.00 ,  Regular pay = 18.00 \* 5 \* 10 = 900.00 
Adding daily wage and overtime wage to find total daily earnings: 
Finally, let's add her daily wage and overtime wage to find her total weekly wage:

Total weekly wage = Daily wage + Overtime wage
= $180.00 + $54.00
= $234.00

Label: Incorrect final weekly wage calculation: 
So, Tina makes $234.00 per week.
Introduction to Daily Wage Calculation: First, let's calculate Tina's daily wage: ,  3. Therefore, her daily wage is: 
Daily hours worked:  2. She works 10 hours every day. ,  4. Tina worked 10 hours every day for 5 days. 
Calculation of daily wage before considering overtime:  = $18.00 * 10 
Calculation of daily wage:  = $180.00 
Determine the number of days Tina works per week.:  1. Tina works for 5 days every week. 
Clarification on Overtime Assumption:  Note that this assumes Tina does not work any overtime. If she does work overtime, her hourly wage would be increased by 1/2 her hourly wage, and she would be paid for the extra hours worked.
Total weekly earnings calculation:  So, Tina makes $720 per week if she works 10 hours every day for 5 days.
Label: Formula for calculating overtime pay:  Overtime pay = Hourly wage x (Hours worked per day - 8) x Days worked ,  = $18.00 x (10 - 8) x 5 ,  = $18.00 x 2 x 5 
Calculation of total overtime pay:  = $90.00 
Summing regular pay and overtime pay:  = $900.00 + $90.00 ,  = $990.00 ,  So, Tina would make $990.00 from working 10 hours every day for 5 days, including overtime.
Label: Identification of normal hourly wage: 1. First, let's calculate Tina's normal hourly wage. She makes $18.00 per hour. , Let's break down the problem:

1. Tina makes $18.00 an hour. 
Determine total weekly hours worked.:  2. Next, we need to determine how much overtime pay she is eligible for. Since she works more than 8 hours per shift and there are 5 days in a week, she works a total of 40 hours per week. 
Calculating total weekly wage formula:  4. Now, we can calculate her total weekly wage by multiplying her normal hourly wage by the number of hours she works per week (including overtime). Total weekly wage = (Normal hourly wage)*(Hours per week) + (Overtime wage)*(Hours per week) 
Calculating total weekly wage using normal and overtime pay rates:  5. Plugging in the values, we get: Total weekly wage = ($18.00)*(40) + ($9.00)*(40) = $720 + $360 = $1,080 ,  So, Tina makes a total of $1,080 per week if she works 10 hours every day for 5 days.
Adding regular pay and overtime pay:  Total pay = 900.00 + 27.00
