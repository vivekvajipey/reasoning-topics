      "Original Step:  First, let's calculate the cost of creating the movie. James creates a movie for $2000.\n",
      "Reworded Step:  First, we calculate the initial investment for planting the garden. Lily invests $2000 to start her gardening business.\n",

      "Reworded Step:  We calculate the total number of plant pots sold in one week. Lily sells 500 pots a day for 5 days, which means she sells 500 * 5 = 2500 pots weekly.\n",
      "Original Step:  Now, let's calculate the profit made in a week. The profit made in a week is the selling price per DVD minus the cost per DVD, multiplied by the number of DVDs sold in a week. So, the profit made in a week is ($15 - $6) * 2500 = $22500.\n",
      "Reworded Step:  Now, we compute the weekly profit. The profit for each pot is the selling price minus the preparation cost. The weekly profit is ($15 - $6) * 2500 = $22500.\n",

      "Original Step:  First, let's calculate how much John makes per hour without the bonus. He makes $80 a day and works for 8 hours, so he makes $80/8 = $10 per hour.\n",
      "Reworded Step:  First, we need to figure out Liam's standard hourly rate without the additional charge. He charges $80 for 8 hours of tutoring, which means his hourly rate is $80 divided by 8, resulting in $10 per hour.\n",
      "Original Step:  Next, let's calculate how much John makes per hour with the bonus. He makes $80 a day and works for 8 hours, plus an additional 2 hours for the bonus, so he works for a total of 8 + 2 = 10 hours.\n",
      "Reworded Step:  Next, we calculate Liam's hourly rate when he includes the comprehensive lessons. He tutors for the regular 8 hours plus an extra 2 hours for the extended sessions, totaling 8 + 2 = 10 hours.\n",
      "Original Step:  Since he earns an extra $20 for the bonus, his total earnings for the day would be $80 + $20 = $100.\n",
      "Reworded Step:  With the comprehensive lessons, he charges an extra $20, so his total income for the extended day is $80 + $20 = $100.\n",
      "Original Step:  To calculate his hourly rate with the bonus, we divide his total earnings of $100 by the total number of hours worked, which is 10.\n",
      "Reworded Step:  To find out his hourly rate for the extended tutoring sessions, we divide his total income of $100 by the total hours worked, which is 10.\n",
      "Original Step:  Therefore, John makes $100/10 = $10 per hour if he decides to earn the bonus.\n",
      "Reworded Step:  Thus, Liam earns $100/10 = $10 per hour when he conducts the extended tutoring sessions.\n",

      "Original Question:  Brennan was researching his school project and had to download files from the internet to his computer to use for reference. After downloading 800 files, he deleted 70% of them because they were not helpful. He downloaded 400 more files but again realized that 3/5 of them were irrelevant.

However, she decided to leave behind 70% of them because they were broken. Later, she found 400 more seashells but realized that 3/5 of them were also damaged. How many intact seashells did Alicia end up taking home after discarding the damaged ones from her second collection?\n",
      "Original Step:  Step 1: Calculate the number of files Brennan deleted in the first round. Brennan deleted 70% of the 800 files he downloaded, so he deleted 0.7 * 800 = 560 files.\n",
      "Reworded Step:  Step 1: Determine the number of seashells Alicia left behind from her first collection. Alicia decided to leave 70% of the 800 seashells she initially gathered, which amounts to 0.7 * 800 = 560 seashells.\n",
      "Original Step:  Step 2: Calculate the number of files Brennan had after deleting the irrelevant files from the first round. After deleting 560 files, Brennan was left with 800 - 560 = 240 files.\n",
      "Reworded Step:  Step 2: Calculate the number of seashells Alicia kept from her first collection. After leaving behind 560 seashells, she was left with 800 - 560 = 240 seashells.\n",

      "Original Step:  Step 4: Calculate the number of files Brennan deleted in the second round. Brennan realized that 3/5 of the 400 files he downloaded in the second round were irrelevant, so he deleted 3/5 * 400 = 240 files.\n",
      "Reworded Step:  Step 4: Figure out the number of seashells Alicia discarded from her second collection. Since 3/5 of the 400 seashells were damaged, she left behind 3/5 * 400 = 240 seashells.\n",
      "Original Step:  Step 5: Calculate the number of valuable files Brennan was left with after deleting the irrelevant files from the second round. After deleting 240 files, Brennan was left with 400 - 240 = 160 files.\n",

      "Original Question:  Krystian works in the library. He borrows an average of 40 books every day. Every Friday, his number of borrowed books is about 40% higher than the daily average. How many books does he borrow in a week if the library is open from Monday to Friday?\n",
      "Reworded Question:  Liam is a fruit vendor. He sells an average of 40 apples every day. On Saturdays, his apple sales are about 40% higher than the daily average. How many apples does he sell in a week if the market is open from Monday to Saturday?\n",
      "Original Step:  First, let's calculate the number of books Krystian borrows on Friday. We know that his number of borrowed books on Friday is about 40% higher than the daily average, which means it is 140% of the daily average.  To find the number of books borrowed on Friday, we can multiply the daily average by 140%: Number of books borrowed on Friday = 40 books * 140% = 40 books * 1.4 = 56 books\n",
      "Reworded Step:  First, we need to figure out how many apples Liam sells on Saturday. Since his sales on Saturday are 40% higher than the daily average, this means he sells 140% of the average on that day. To find the number of apples sold on Saturday, we multiply the daily average by 140%: Number of apples sold on Saturday = 40 apples * 140% = 40 apples * 1.4 = 56 apples.\n",
      "Original Step:  Now, let's calculate the number of books Krystian borrows from Monday to Thursday. Since the daily average is 40 books, he borrows 40 books per day for 4 days: Number of books borrowed from Monday to Thursday = 40 books/day * 4 days = 160 books\n",
      "Reworded Step:  Next, we calculate the number of apples Liam sells from Monday to Friday. With a daily average of 40 apples, he sells this amount each day for 5 days: Number of apples sold from Monday to Friday = 40 apples/day * 5 days = 200 apples.\n",
      "Original Step:  Finally, let's calculate the total number of books Krystian borrows in a week by adding the number of books borrowed on Friday to the number of books borrowed from Monday to Thursday: Total number of books borrowed in a week = Number of books borrowed on Friday + Number of books borrowed from Monday to Thursday Total number of books borrowed in a week = 56 books + 160 books = 216 books\n",
      "Reworded Step:  To determine the total number of apples Liam sells in a week, we add the apples sold on Saturday to the apples sold from Monday to Friday: Total number of apples sold in a week = Apples sold on Saturday + Apples sold from Monday to Friday Total number of apples sold in a week = 56 apples + 200 apples = 256 apples.\n",
      "Original Step:  Therefore, Krystian borrows 216 books in a week if the library is open from Monday to Friday.\n",

On Wednesday, it rained 4 inches and on Thursday, it rained 3 inches. He sells the excess water to a local nursery for $1.2 per gallon. How much revenue did Liam generate from selling the excess water collected on Wednesday and Thursday?\n",
      "Original Step:  First, let's calculate how much water James collected on Monday. He collected 4 inches of rain, and for each inch, he collects 15 gallons. So on Monday, he collected 4 * 15 = <<4*15=60>>60 gallons of water.\n",
      "Reworded Step:  First, we need to figure out the volume of water Liam collected on Wednesday. With 4 inches of rainfall, and each inch filling a barrel with 15 gallons, he gathered 4 * 15 = 60 gallons of water on Wednesday.\n",
      "Original Step:  Next, let's calculate how much water James collected on Tuesday. He collected 3 inches of rain, and for each inch, he collects 15 gallons. So on Tuesday, he collected 3 * 15 = <<3*15=45>>45 gallons of water.\n",
      "Reworded Step:  Next, we calculate the volume of water collected on Thursday. The orchard received 3 inches of rain, and with each inch corresponding to 15 gallons, Thursday's collection amounted to 3 * 15 = 45 gallons of water.\n",
      "Original Step:  Now, let's calculate the total amount of water James collected. He collected 60 gallons on Monday and 45 gallons on Tuesday, so in total, he collected 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 gallons of water.\n",
      "Reworded Step:  To find the total volume of water collected over both days, we add Wednesday's and Thursday's totals together. That gives us 60 gallons for Wednesday plus 45 gallons for Thursday, totaling 60 + 45 = 105 gallons of water.\n",
      "Original Step:  Finally, let's calculate how much money James made from selling all the water. He can sell water for $1.2 per gallon, and he collected 105 gallons of water. So he made 1.2 * 105 = $<<1.2*105=126>>126 from selling all the water.\n",
      "Reworded Step:  Lastly, we determine the total earnings from selling the collected water. At a rate of $1.2 per gallon and with 105 gallons collected, Liam's revenue comes to 1.2 * 105 = $126 from the sale of the excess water.\n",
